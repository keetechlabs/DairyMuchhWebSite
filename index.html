            <p>Ethical Farming Our cows and buffaloes are fed natural fodder and roam freely in open

                Milking with Care We use automated and hygienic milking techniques to maintain purity.
                Stringent Quality Checks Every batch undergoes multiple quality tests, ensuring the highest

            <h1>NO PRESERVATIVES</h1>
            <p> Nothing screams “better” than chemical additives and artificial stabilisers. <br>
                Preservatives are great if you want:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> that lasts forever but has zero real nutrition. </li>
                    <li>A product that tastesMilk the same in summer, winter, or the zombie apocalypse.</li>
                    <li> To never question what's actually inside your milk</li> </ul>
            <br />
                 
                If that sounds good, <b>Dairy Muchh</b> isn't for you. If you want fresh, natural milk that respects your
                health, well… welcome to the family.</p>

            <h1>ABOUT NUTRIENTS</h1>
            <p>Our <b>Dairy Muchh</b> milk is packed with essential nutrients like Calcium and Vitamin D, Because there is no milk without these.</p>
            <p>Well, let's use some common sense here. Can anyone predict exactly how much fat or protein a
                cow or buffalo will give tomorrow? Nope! That depends on seasons, climate, and what they
                naturally eat. <br> At <b>Dairy Muchh</b>, we don't play that game. We simply feed our cattle good fodder and fresh grass,
                and we give you milk as nature intended—pure, raw, and unaltered. </p>
