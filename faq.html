            <div class="question">Q1: How is Dairy Much milk so fresh while other brands’ milk lasts forever?</div>
            <div class="answer">💡 Good question! While we deliver raw, farm-fresh milk the very next morning, other brands treat their milk like it’s going on a world tour. Their milk takes a detour through factories, high-temperature pasteurisation, preservative baths, and cold storage before it finally reaches you—weeks later! Now, is that really fresh? 🤷</div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q2: Why does your milk spoil in 2-3 days while packet milk lasts for weeks?</div>
            <div class="answer">Because our milk is actually real milk! 🥛 No preservatives, no chemicals, no ultra-processing. Just pure, raw milk, as nature intended. If your milk lasts longer than some relationships, you might want to ask yourself, “What exactly am I drinking?” 😬</div>

            <div class="question">Q4: How do I know your milk is actually chemical-free?</div>
            <div class="answer">We encourage you to test it yourself! We provide a mini testing kit so you can see the truth. We also upload daily test reports on our app. If our milk had anything unnatural, we wouldn’t be handing out test kits so confidently, would we?</div>

            <div class="question">Q5: Why does Dairy Much milk taste better than packet milk?</div>
            <div class="answer">Because it’s real milk! 😄 It hasn’t been boiled, processed, stored, and packed into plastic for weeks. You’re tasting milk exactly as it should be—fresh, creamy, and naturally delicious.</div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q7: Why don’t you use preservatives? Won’t that make the milk “better”?</div>
            <div class="answer">Oh yes, nothing screams “better” than chemical additives and artificial stabilisers. 🙃 Preservatives are great if you want:<br>
                ✔ Milk that lasts forever but has zero real nutrition. <br>
                ✔ A product that tastes the same in summer, winter, or the zombie apocalypse. <br>
                ✔ To never question what’s actually inside your milk. <br>
                If that sounds good, Dairy Much isn’t for you. If you want fresh, natural milk that respects your health, well… welcome to the family. 😎
